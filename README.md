# code_samples
Here are code samples I've worked on. (The vast majority of code I work on is proprietary, and it cannot be shared publicly)

In fitting_cancer_model.r, I use Approximate Bayesian Computation and Approximate Bayesian Computation with Random Forest to perform inference on a cancer model

In hmm_NLP.py, I implement a hidden markov model to make part of speech predictions on words in a document

In streaming_eeg.py, I stream a recording from a scalp openBCI EEG headset
